Empowering individuals to analyze their personal genomics data using publicly available tools. 

# Who? 

For individuals who have used personal genomics services to sequence/genotype their genome and would like to get benefitted from the latest research findings in the space

# Why?

Personal Genomics sequencing companies typically provide a "snapshot-in-time" report for their consumers which is based on the available knowledge at that time. However, the domain percision medicine is developing at a rapid pace. Our goal is to empower individuals to gain more insights into their datasets using latest state-of-art approaches and databases.

# What?
We would like to provide a cookbook and links to services like Globus Genomics, Galaxy and databases like clinvar, clingen etc that will enable individuals perform this analysis on their own

# How?
